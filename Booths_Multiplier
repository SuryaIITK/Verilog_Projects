# Booth Multiplier with Verilog

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a Booth multiplier, which is a binary multiplication algorithm designed to improve the performance of multiplication operations. The project includes both the data path and control path designs.

## Features

- **Data Path Implementation**: 
  - Handles arithmetic operations and data manipulation using shift registers, an ALU, and a counter.
  
- **Control Path Implementation**: 
  - Manages the sequence of operations and controls the data path components through various states.

- **Testbenches**: 
  - Validates functionality and performance of the multiplier through comprehensive simulation.


## File Descriptions

- `booth_data_path.v` : Contains the data path implementation including shift registers, ALU, and counter.
- `booth_control_path.v` : Contains the control path implementation with state management and control signals.
- `Booths_Multiplier_tb.v` : Testbench for simulating the Booth multiplier and monitoring its operation.
